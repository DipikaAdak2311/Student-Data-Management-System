# Student-Data-management-system
My first repository on github. 
It is a python based stand-alone application where one can add, delete, update and view student details(roll no, name, marks) for different subjects. 
Based on the student details a bar graph will be generated.
This project uses tkinter for frontend, sqlite3 for backend and bs4, json for webscrapping qoute of the day, temperature, location.
